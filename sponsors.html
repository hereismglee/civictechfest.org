This conference aims to analyze and assess the development of civic tech, and focuses on studying the impact and effectiveness of civic tech under different social environments and political contexts.</p><p>Over the course of the conference, TICTeC looks to provide in-depth analysis regarding online participation tools, digital democracy tools, as well as their influence and popularity. Their findings act as important reference points for future development of the field. In comparison to other tech focused conferences, TICTeC has a more research and academic focus, and emphasizes the connection between online/offline tech with society.</p><p>As technology develops faster each day, and as society and politics develop comparatively slower, TICTeC is a way for civic tech advocates and critics to build a bridge for open government, democratic deepening, and civic participation to march forward. We hope through TICTeC@Taipei, we can build a global network of civic tech enthusiasts and have in-depth link to Taiwan &amp; Asia communities.</p></div></div></section></div></section><section id="host" class="styles-section__7bwgt"><h2 class="styles-header__3dbkE">Host</h2><div><section class="styles-about__1B6pk"><div class="styles-title__2inEz"><h3>WCIT 2017 TAIWAN</h3><a href="http://www.wcit2017.org/" target="_blank"><i class="styles-icon__1ipGX">home</i><!-- react-text: 113 -->www.wcit2017.org<!-- /react-text --></a></div><div class="styles-content__lrP9v"><div class="styles-logo__3wtqV"><img src="/a5b5ecd163dd2001ec29ad2093db8826.jpg"></div><div class="styles-desc__2X2-r"><p class="styles-brief__1fXZv"></p><p>The 21st World Congress on Information Technology(WCIT 2017) is the parallel event of #CivicTechFest.
